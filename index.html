    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What It Means to “Try” a Card Without Applying</h2>
      <p>There is no safe way to fully try a credit card in the same sense as testing a free app. Applications, approvals and account openings are formal decisions with potential impact on your credit file. However, you can use structured comparisons and documentation to narrow down options before you decide whether to apply.</p>
      <p>From a documentation perspective, “trying” a card means checking how its fees, rewards, protections and eligibility signals align with your situation, and then verifying those impressions against the issuer’s official terms. This page focuses on that process rather than any particular product.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Steps for Using Comparisons as a Trial Run</h2>
      <p>Neutral comparison pages can help you simulate how a card might fit your everyday use. A simple approach often includes:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Defining your use-case</strong> – for example travel, everyday spending, rebuilding credit or business expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtering by obvious deal-breakers</strong> – such as large annual fees, foreign transaction fees or missing card networks in your region.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparing two–four candidates side by side</strong> – looking at fees, rewards, protections and basic eligibility signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Opening official documentation for each candidate</strong> – to validate any details that influenced your short list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This process does not guarantee approval or outcomes, but it can reduce the number of cards you seriously consider and help you focus on those that appear structurally compatible with your needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Comparisons Can and Cannot Tell You</h2>
      <p>Comparison pages are good at summarising publicly documented features, including fees, reward structures and example protections. They can also highlight broad audience labels, such as travel-focused cards, student cards or products designed for rebuilding credit.</p>
      <p>They cannot promise individual approval, estimate your personal credit limits or fully capture the long-term effects of account management on your credit file. Those aspects are driven by issuer decisions, credit bureau rules and your own behaviour over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Using Comparisons to Avoid Unnecessary Friction</h2>
      <p>By treating comparisons as a trial filter, you can avoid applying for cards that obviously do not fit your profile or priorities. Examples include cards with benefits you are unlikely to use, fee structures that do not match your budget, or requirements that clearly fall outside your current circumstances.</p>
      <p>This does not replace personalised advice. It simply helps you move from a large, unstructured list of cards to a small number of candidates worth examining more closely with official documents and, if needed, professional guidance.</p>
